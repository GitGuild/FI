# Summary  

Founder Institute Panama (FI PTY) is a chapter of [Founder Institute](http://fi.co) graduating 13 founders in June 2016. The Git Guild Ambassador Ira Miller is a Co-Director of FI PTY. Additionally, Priticity is both an FI graduate, as well as a Git Guild partner candidate. FI PTY does not generate revenue, nor does it have funding for a graduation party.

The Git Guild is about to publicly launch, and begin general marketing activities. The investors, technology journalists, and startup founders who will attend FI PTY graduation are a great demographic to market to. Since the Ambassador and Priticity will both be featured, it is possible that media coverage will include the Git Guild.

### Tasks & Deliverables

The deliverable here is a grand graduation event for FI PTY. To help this process take shape, the following are requirements.

 + Git Guild branded banners
 + Git Guild themed slide displayed on projector or big screen TV
 + Open bar
 + Classy venue (i.e. Riu)
 + 100 guest cap

# Economics  

__Note that 1 TGG currently equals US$1__

### Funding

3,000 TGG

The seed funding for this project comes directly from the Git Guild treasury. Since marketing is a basic, organization-wide need, new coins were issued to fund the project. Please note that these coins are backed by revenues generated within the Treasury. (i.e. BTC & DASH appreciation)

### Accounting

FI Co-Directors Sebastian Mendoza and Ira Miller are sponsible for accounting for all expenditures, and submitting as a CSV. Any receipts are to be retained.

Any excess funds are to be used to sponsor the next session of FI PTY in the name of the Git Guild.
